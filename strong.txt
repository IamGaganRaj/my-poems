For the first time
I'am doing just fine
because I know you're only mine
you make me feel so divine
It's hard to believe that it's real 
All my wounds are above to heal

you make me feel strong
you make me feel blessed
you make me feel I'm the best
you make me feel good
you make me feel
and you make me feel now I'am complete

now a days It feel a bid different
but I don't know why
May be because I've always been different
I'am just a kid who used to be shy
I'am not familier with this kind of love.
I'm used to getting rejected
Maybe my life's taking a new curve
unit now I'm used to getting neglected

Beware the Ides of March.
The lady doth protest too much, methinks

my son gagan pawan
they both are very nice human
they don't think about loss and gain.
they just want to enjoy in the happiness rain..
they have a sharp brain..
they know how to train.

difficult road often lead to beautiful destinations

nothing has changed
bad is still bad

never ever ever getting back together
